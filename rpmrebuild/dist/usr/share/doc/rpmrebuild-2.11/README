summary
--------
rpmrebuild is a tool to build an rpm file from the rpm database
of installed softwares.
It can be used to quickly build modified rpm packages.

how does it work
-----------------
The rpm database contains many things,in fact all what is need to build the rpm file
(even the pre/post install scripts).
One can access the database in shell-script (rpm -q), or throw an API in C language.
I choose the shell-script for portability, debug facility, and because there was no 
performance need.

warning : 
---------
- the rebuild is done from the installed files, so, if there was some
modifications (config or so), they are reported in the new package.
but I show what is concerned
- if the original package was signed, the new one is not

last remark : 
-------------
the rpm software as now a "repackage" option but :
- it is not documented in man page
- it can only be used in erase command (rpm -e --repackage), this can be not possible because of dependencies
- for informations, the result goes to /var/spool/up2date

historic
----------
In 1999, I had a big problem, when updating a package : the new version was not working !
So I had to "go back", but it was impossible to find the old rpm file (on local disk, or on the net).
I just had it installed, on another host ...

I do not find any tool on the net, so I write a first release for this need, and I use it rarely.
But, in July 2002, I had a request from another Linux admin.
As the script seems to match a more general need, I decide to put public on the net, as a project 
over the Gnu Public License.
