          This command uploads a capture of the specified source directory to
          a Google-hosted Git repository accessible with the current project's
          credentials. If the name of an existing capture is provided, the
          existing capture will be modified to include the new files.

          context json file describing the capture.

          See [](https://cloud.google.com/tools/cloud-debugger/) for details on
