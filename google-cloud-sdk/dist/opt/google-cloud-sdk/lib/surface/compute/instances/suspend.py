        *{command}* is used to suspend a Google Compute Engine virtual machine.
        Suspending a VM is the equivalent of hibernate:
        the guest receives an ACPI S3 suspend signal, after which all VM state
        is saved to temporary storage.  An instance can only be suspended while
        it is in the RUNNING state.  A suspended instance will be put in
        SUSPENDED state.

        Alpha restrictions: Suspending a Preemptible VM is not supported and
        will result in an API error. Suspending a VM that is using CSEK is not
        supported and will result in an API error.
