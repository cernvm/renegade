  Obtains user access credentials via a web flow for the Google Cloud Platform
  resources of the given account, and puts them in the well-known location for
  Application Default Credentials to use them as a proxy for a service account.

  This command is useful for when you are developing code that would normally
  use a service account, but you need to run the code in a local development
  environment, and it is easier to provide user credentials.
  These user credentials will then be used as a "proxy" for an associated
  service account. The credentials will apply to all projects accessed through
  Application Default Credentials. This command has no effect on the user
  account(s) used with the `gcloud auth login` command, but any existing
  credentials previously installed by this command (or
  `gcloud auth application-default activate-service-account`) will be
  overwritten.
