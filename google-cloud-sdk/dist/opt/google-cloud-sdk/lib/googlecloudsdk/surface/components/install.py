          Components that are available for installation can be viewed by

          Installing a given component will also install all components on which
          it depends.  The command lists all components it is about to install,
          and asks for confirmation before proceeding.

          ``{command}'' installs components from the version of the Cloud SDK
          you currently have installed.  You can see your current version by
          running:

            $ {top_command} version

          If you want to update your Cloud SDK installation to the latest
          available version, use:
