"""Docker image and docker container classes.

In Docker terminology image is a read-only layer that never changes.
Container is created once you start a process in Docker from an Image. Container
consists of read-write layer, plus information about the parent Image, plus
some additional information like its unique ID, networking configuration,
and resource limits.
For more information refer to http://docs.docker.io/.

Mapping to Docker CLI:
Image is a result of "docker build path/to/Dockerfile" command.
ImageOptions allows to pass parameters to these commands.

Versions 1.9 and 1.10 of docker remote API are supported.
