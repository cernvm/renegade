# Google Cloud SDK - Release Notes

Copyright 2014-2015 Google Inc. All rights reserved.

## 0.9.88 (2015/11/25)

### Breaking Changes

* The `gcloud preview app run` command has now been removed. Please use the
  bundled `dev_appserver.py` script directly instead.

* App Engine: The 'version' and 'application' fields in module and configuration
  files are now illegal. Project name should instead be specified either by
  `gcloud config set project MY_PROJECT` or by setting the `--project` flag on
  individual command executions. Versions are generated automatically by default
  but can also be manually specified by setting the `--version` flag on
  individual command executions.

### App Engine

* Don't do runtime identification for custom runtimes during deploy. This fixes
  issue [#387](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=387).

* The `dev_appserver.py` script no longer requires the installation of all App
  Engine components. It will install only the necessary ones at run time.
  Fixes [#273](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=273)

### Core

* Added the `gcloud components install` command.  This allows you to install
  missing components at the version of the SDK you currently have (it does not
  update your SDK installation).  `gcloud components update` should now only be
  used to update your SDK to the latest version.

* Fixes [#293](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=293)
  related SSL certificate validation issues.

* Use zsh builtins in path.zsh.inc for faster/cleaner shell startup.

## 0.9.87 (2015/11/18)

### Compute

* `gcloud alpha compute instances create` now supports --custom-cpu and
   --custom-memory flags to specify custom machine types.

### Dataproc

* Added `gcloud beta dataproc clusters diagnose` command. See
  <https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/support/diagnose-command> for more info.

### Google Container Engine

* Updated kubectl to version 1.1.1.

## 0.9.86 (2015/11/11)

### App Engine

* Generated node.js Dockerfiles now add the full application context before
  running install hooks.

* For Google App Engine Node.js runtimes, install requested version of node
  prior to doing an npm install.

### Compute

* `gcloud beta compute instances set-machine-type` has been promoted from alpha
  to beta,

## 0.9.85 (2015/11/04)

### Breaking Changes

* `gcloud alpha compute networks create` now requires --mode flag.

### App Engine

* Added the --output-directory option to gen-repo-info-file command. This option
  supersedes --output-file, which is deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release.

* Improved error message when specified yaml file is not found.

### Compute

* Launching `gcloud alpha compute networks subnets`.

* `gcloud compute alpha instance-templates` and `instances` now support
  subnetworks.

* New flag --ike-networks in `gcloud alpha compute vpn-tunnels create`.

* `gcloud compute ssh` now passes through the exit code of the ssh command. This
  fixes issue
  [#146 ](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=146).

### Misc. Changes

* Gracefully handle socket timeouts while checking for Google Compute Engine
  metadata server. This fixes issue
  [#339](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=339).

## 0.9.84 (2015/10/28)

### App Engine

* Due to PageSpeed service deprecation, user will receive a warning when
  deploying a new version to App Engine.

* Implemented fingerprinting support for Java.

* The gen-config flag now generates only app.yaml for the matching runtime by
  default, you must use the --custom flag to generate an app.yaml with a runtime
  of "custom" and Dockerfile (and other configs).

### Compute

* GA support for HTTPS load balancing features.

* Deprecated --clear-target-pool flag from compute instance-groups managed
  set-target-pools command.

### Windows support

* Windows Installer can now take a /logtofile flag to write installation logs to
  file CloudSDKInstall.log located in the same directory.

* Windows installer now displays an error message when the installation
  does not succeed.

### Command Line Interface support

* The [page=N] table format attribute prints one or more tables of at most N
  rows. Use this to view paged server data as it arrives at the client.

## 0.9.83 (2015/10/21)

### App Engine

* In a future release, the `gcloud preview app deploy` command will no longer
  support deploying multiple modules in the same invocation.

### Compute

* Ubuntu 14.10 is end of life: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases

* Fixed external issue
  [#291](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=291),
  related to handling network addresses on Windows.

### Container Engine

* `gcloud container clusters list` now displays the current number of nodes
  for the cluster.

### Windows support

* When running Cloud SDK tools from PowerShell the `gcloud-ps.ps1` wrapper
  scripts now can be used which no longer call to `cmd.exe`. Using `gcloud-ps`,
  complex arguments can be passed without escaping for Windows command line.
  Using `gcloud`, the following command would be correctly escaped when running
  gcloud in PowerShell:

    gcloud fun --arg='"test ^< 123"'

  With the new `gcloud-ps`, the same command can be simply written as:

    gcloud-ps fun --arg='test < 123'

  Permissions to run PowerShell scripts must be given to PowerShell before these
  will work. Permissions can be changed with
  `"Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"`.

## 0.9.82 (2015/10/14)

### App Engine

*   The App Engine Admin API is now the default path for deployments in the
    `gcloud preview app deploy` command. This transition should be transparent,
    but if you experience any issues and would like to revert to the old
    behavior, please run `gcloud config set app/use_appengine_api false`.

    See <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/> for more
    information about this API.

*   With `env: 2`, valid python runtimes are `python` and `python-compat`.

*   Implemented fingerprinting support for python.

### Container Engine

*   `gcloud container clusters create`: The flag `--container-ipv4-cidr` has
    been deprecated; `--cluster-ipv4-cidr` should be used instead.

### SQL

*   `gcloud beta sql operations describe` and `gcloud beta sql operations wait`
    no longer need `--instance` flag (`gcloud beta sql operations list` still
    does).

*   Fixed issue with `gcloud sql instances clone` when `--bin-log-file-name` and
    `--bin-log-position` are set.
    (<https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=201>).

## 0.9.81 (2015/10/07)

### Breaking Changes

*   If you are using a service account to run commands under
    `gcloud preview app`, you must enable the "App Engine Admin API" in the
    Developers Console (<https://console.developers.google.com>; navigate to
    **APIs and Auth > APIs**).

*   In a future Cloud SDK release, deployments that promote the new version to
    receive all traffic will stop the previous version by default.

    To keep the current behavior, pass the `--no-stop-previous-version`
    flag, or run the following command:

       $ gcloud config set app/stop_previous_version false

*   Removed `app get-resource-limits` command.

### App Engine

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.27. Please see the following release
    notes for details:
    *   Python: <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/release-notes>
    *   Java: <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/release-notes>
*   The `gcloud preview app deploy` command now requires that users specify or
    omit the runtime: field from app.yaml if a Dockerfile is also specified.
*   The `gcloud preview app deploy` command now supports the "engines" field in
    package.json for node.js applications.

### Misc. Changes

*   Windows Installer has an option to run `gcloud init` after the installation
  finishes.

## 0.9.80 (2015/09/30)

*   `gcloud app`
    *   Soon, deployments will set the deployed version to receive all traffic
        by default.  To keep the current behavior, use the `--no-promote` flag
        or run the following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default false

        To adopt the new behavior early, use the `--promote` flag or run the
        following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default true

    *   The `--set-default` flag is deprecated. Please use the `--promote` flag
        instead.
    *   In a future Cloud SDK release, deployments that promote the new version
        to receive all traffic will stop the previous version by default.  To
        keep the current behavior, pass the `--no-stop-previous-version` flag,
        or run the following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/stop_previous_version true

    *   The `app run` command is deprecated and will soon be removed.  Please
        use dev_appserver (found in the same directory as the `gcloud command)
        instead.
    *   The `gcloud preview app modules download command` is deprecated, and
        will be removed soon.

*   The Windows installer has an option to run `gcloud init` after the
    installation finishes.
*   The `preview` component has been removed.
    *   The `gcloud preview app` commands remain available as usual and
        are still shipped through the `app` component.
    *   Please use `gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged` instead
        of `gcloud preview instance-groups`.  Note that you will need to
        modify some command invocations when switching to the non-preview
        commands.
    *   Please use `gcloud compute instance-groups managed` instead of
        `gcloud preview managed-instance-groups`.  Note that you will need to
        modify some command invocations when switching to the non-preview
        commands.
*   All Google Compute User Accounts commands have moved to beta.
*   Deployment-manager list commands now support pagination.
*   Minor bug fixes.

## 0.9.79 (2015/09/23)

*   The following commands have been promoted from beta to GA:
    *   gcloud config configurations ...
    *   gcloud source repos clone
    *   gcloud beta init. Old `gcloud init` behavior has been removed, and
        partially replaced by new gcloud init or directly via gcloud source
        repos clone.
*   Release gcloud beta dataproc.
*   The --env-vars flag in gcloud preview app deploy has been removed.
*   Automatic ssh key generation respects the --quiet flag.
*   The --format flag now supports extended format expressions. For details run
    $ gcloud topic formats.
*   Most commands now document the positive Boolean --FLAG form and accept
    --no-FLAG to disable. For the past few releases --log-http accepted an
    optional true/false value. It has been restored to its original definition
    of being a Boolean flag that has no value.
*   `gcloud sql` operations are now automatically retried for 2s in case of
    HttpException: The Cloud SQL instance operation does not exist.
*   Update gcloud's kubectl from 1.0.5 to 1.0.6.
*   Deprecate `gcloud preview app get-resource-limits`.

## 0.9.78 (2015/09/16)

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.26. Please visit
    <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkReleaseNotes> for
    details.
*   Increase the default boot disk size for remote build VMs in
    `gcloud preview app deploy`.
*   The `--instance` flag to the `gcloud preview app modules set-managed-by`
    command now takes an instance name instead of an index.
*   The V1Beta4 API for sqladmin can now be accessed through the
    `gcloud beta sql` surface.
*   Usability enhancements for `gcloud beta init` and named configurations.

## 0.9.77 (2015/09/09)

*   gcloud preview logging is now gcloud beta logging.
*   Update kubectl to version 1.0.5
*   Windows Cloud SDK installer improvements:
    *   Now allows changing the installation mode. You can choose between a
        "current user" installation and an "all users" installation.
    *   Now has an uninstaller and writes "Add/Remove Programs" uninstall
        entries.
*   Removal of unsupported --env-vars argument from gcloud preview app deploy.
*   gcloud compute instance groups: Allow --named-ports flag to be empty and
    clean named ports in set-named-ports commands.
*   Change in gcloud compute backend-services: introduce new flag
    --instance-group which takes advantage of new Instance Groups API.

## 0.9.76 (2015/09/02)

*   Update gsutil component to 4.14.
*   Resource views commands have moved from preview to alpha. Please use `gcloud
    alpha compute resource-views` in place of `gcloud preview resource-views`.
*   Replica pool commands have moved from preview to alpha. Please use `gcloud
    alpha compute replica-pools` in place of `gcloud preview replica-pools`.
*   `gcloud beta source repo` was renamed to `gcloud beta source repos`
*   Created google-cloud-sdk-announce@googlegroups.com
    <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/google-cloud-sdk-announce> email group to

*   Add target size of managed instance group for "compute instance-groups
    managed list" command.
*   Fixed the removal of platform-specific components when running `gcloud
    components remove`.
*   Fixed a bug related to checking for SDK updates when the SDK is installed as
    root (like on Debian Compute Engine images).
    *   Affected users should now see less frequent update messages and overall
        improved gcloud performance
*   `gcloud preview app deploy` won't update local images automatically anymore.

## 0.9.75 (2015/08/26)

*   Container Engine
    *   Container Engine GA commands available under `gcloud container`.
    *   `gcloud beta container get-credentials` now takes cluster name as
        argument instead of `--cluster` flag for consistency with other
        commands.
    *   Added `gcloud alpha container clusters update <cluster>
        --cloud-monitoring=<val>` command.
*   New release notes are printed on upgrade. (This won't take effect until
    an upgrade from this version to a later version.)
*   New `gcloud alpha genomics variantsets export` command.
*   Commands promoted from `gcloud alpha` to `gcloud beta`:
    *    `gcloud beta config configurations ...`
    *    `gcloud beta sources clone`
*   Improvements in error reporting and default output formatting.


## 0.9.74 (2015/08/19)

*   New list and import commands under `gcloud alpha genomics variants`.
*   Removed `--remote` flag. Instead, please use the `--docker-build=remote`
    flag (or use `--docker-build=local` to force a local build).
*   In this release, Docker builds are hosted by default. To opt-in to the old
    behavior, please use the `--docker-build=local` flag.


## 0.9.73 (2015/08/12)

*   gcloud sql instances create default to MySQL 5.6
*   gcloud beta container get-credentials renamed to gcloud beta container
    clusters get-credentials

    *   gcloud beta emulators datastore ...
    *   gcloud beta container get-server-config
    *   gcloud alpha config configurations


## 0.9.72 (2015/08/05)

*   gcloud compute
    *   initial surface changes for the backend-bucket.
    *   `instance-groups set-named-ports`: introduced a new flag
        `--named-ports NAME:PORT,[NAME:PORT,...]` - no need to specify names
        and ports in separate flags.
*   gcloud preview app deploy
    Deprecate `--remote` flag in preparation for hosted Docker builds by
    default. Instead, please use the `--docker-build={remote,local}` flag.
    The default is still a local Docker build; in two releases, the default
    will switch to a hosted build.
*   New gcloud alpha genomics operations {list, cancel, describe} commands


## 0.9.71 (2015/07/29)

*   Launching `gcloud alpha pubsub` commands.
*   Moved `gcloud preview rolling-updates` to `gcloud alpha compute
    rolling-updates`.

    disks.
*   Beta launch of customer supplied encryption keys for Compute Engine.
*   Updated kubectl to 1.0.1.
*   `gcloud alpha container` commands now target Container Engine v1 API.
    Options for `gcloud alpha container clusters create` updated accordingly:
    *   `--user` renamed to `--username`
    *   `--cluster-api-version` removed. Cluster version is not selectable in v1
        API; new clusters always created at latest supported version.
    *   `--image` option removed. Source image not selectable in v1 API;
        clusters are always created with latest supported ContainerVM image.
        Note that using an unsupported image (i.e. not ContainerVM) would
        result in an unusable cluster in most cases anyway.
    *   Added `--no-enable-cloud-monitoring` to turn off cloud monitoring
        (on by default).
    *   Added `--disk-size` option for specifying boot disk size of node vms.
*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.24. Please visit
    <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkReleaseNotes> for
    details.

    For several months on the Managed VMs team we've been testing a new mode of
    `dockerless` local development on gcloud that makes developing a module for
    Python, Java and Go users similar to development of regular App Engine
    applications. This new mode relaxes the sandbox constraints present in the
    devappserver for `vm: false` applications, and does not require Docker to be
    installed.

    You can currently opt-into this behavior by setting GAE_LOCAL_VM_RUNTIME=1;
    In this release of the Cloud SDK, we will be making this behavior the
    default for Managed VM users who are using gcloud.

    You can still opt-out of this behavior by setting: GAE_LOCAL_VM_RUNTIME=0.

    For custom runtime users, if you are relying on the local Development Server
    to build your application, will now need to pass the `--custom-entrypoint`
    flag to `gcloud preview app run` to provide gcloud with the correct
    command to call.

    This does not affect users developing for non-managed VMs, or for users who
    are not using gcloud."
*   Bug fixes for:
    *   `gcloud preview app deploy` file paths issue on Windows.
    *   `gcloud compute instance-groups managed wait-until-stable` periodic user
        prompting for target zone.


## 0.9.70 (2015/07/22)

*   Add `gcloud compute instance-groups` commands.
*   Move `gcloud beta deployment-manager` commands to general availability as
    `gcloud deployment-manager` and update to use the v2beta3 API. This change
    does not alter the gcloud surface for users of the deployment-manager
    component.
*   Update kubectl to 1.0.0.
*   `gcloud alpha genomics` commands now use the genomics V1 API. The
    --project-number flag for `dataset create` and `dataset list` is now
    obsolete. The configured --project-id is used instead and can be overridden
    with the --project-id flag.
*   Fix hang on errors in `gcloud preview app deploy`.

## 0.9.69 (2015/07/15)

*   Update kubectl to 0.20.2.
*   Fix an authentication issue with 'gcloud docker' affecting docker version
    1.7.0 and later.
*   Remove `gcloud preview dm-v2` command group.
*   Remove `gcloud preview deployment-manager` command group
    (`gcloud beta deployment-manager` still exists; see
    <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#install-version> if you want to pin your
    installation to an old version).
*   Bug fixes.

## 0.9.68 (2015/07/08)

*   Deprecated gcutil tool is no longer distributed with Cloud SDK.
    It is still available via <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcutil>.
*   Added support for Container engine BETA commands under the
    `gcloud beta container` command group.  Existing `gcloud alpha container`
    commands are unchanged.

    SDK.
    *    App Engine functionality can still be used through the
        `gcloud preview app` command group.
    *    The gae-java, gae-python, gae-php, and gae-go components no longer
         exist in the component manager.
    *    If you need to use appcfg or dev_appserver directly, these are still
         available in the App Engine SDK downloads that can be found here:
         <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads>
*   Bug fixes.

## 0.9.67 (2015/07/01)

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.23. Please visit
    <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkReleaseNotes> for
    details.
