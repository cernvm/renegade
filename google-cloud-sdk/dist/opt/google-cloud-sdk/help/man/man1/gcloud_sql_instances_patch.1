.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Updates the settings of a Cloud SQL instance.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fIINSTANCE\fR
.RS 2m
Cloud SQL instance ID.


.RE

.SH "FLAGS"

\fB\-\-activation\-policy\fR \fIACTIVATION_POLICY\fR
.RS 2m
The activation policy for this instance. This specifies when the instance should
be activated and is applicable only when the instance state is RUNNABLE.

.RE
\fB\-\-assign\-ip\fR
.RS 2m
The instance must be assigned an IP address. Use \fB\-\-no\-assign\-ip\fR to
disable.

.RE
\fB\-\-async\fR
.RS 2m
Do not wait for the operation to complete.

.RE
\fB\-\-authorized\-gae\-apps\fR \fIAPP\fR,[\fIAPP\fR,...]
.RS 2m
A list of App Engine app IDs that can access this instance.

.RE
\fB\-\-authorized\-networks\fR \fINETWORK\fR,[\fINETWORK\fR,...]
.RS 2m
The list of external networks that are allowed to connect to the instance.
Specified in CIDR notation, also known as 'slash' notation (e.g.
192.168.100.0/24).

.RE
\fB\-\-backup\-start\-time\fR \fIBACKUP_START_TIME\fR

.RS 2m
Clear the list of external networks that are allowed to connect to the instance.

.RE
\fB\-\-clear\-database\-flags\fR
.RS 2m
Clear the database flags set on the instance. WARNING: Instance will be
restarted.

.RE
\fB\-\-clear\-gae\-apps\fR
.RS 2m
Specified to clear the list of App Engine apps that can access this instance.

.RE
\fB\-\-database\-flags\fR \fIFLAG\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,[\fIFLAG\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
.RS 2m
A comma\-separated list of database flags to set on the instance. Use an equals
sign to separate flag name and value. Flags without values, like
skip_grant_tables, can be written out without a value after, e.g.,
\f5skip_grant_tables=\fR. Use on/off for booleans. View the Instance Resource
API for allowed flags. (e.g., \f5\-\-database\-flags
max_allowed_packet=55555,skip_grant_tables=,log_output=1\fR)
