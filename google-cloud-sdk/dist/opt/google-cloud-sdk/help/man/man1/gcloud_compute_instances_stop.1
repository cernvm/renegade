\fB\-\-zone\fR \fIZONE\fR
.RS 2m
The zone of the instance to stop. If not specified, you will be prompted to

\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
