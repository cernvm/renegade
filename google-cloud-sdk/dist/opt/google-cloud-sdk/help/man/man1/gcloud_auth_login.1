.SH "NAME"

gcloud auth login \- authorize gcloud to access Google Cloud Platform



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud auth login\fR [\fIACCOUNT\fR] [\fB\-\-activate\fR] [\fB\-\-brief\fR] [\fB\-\-enable\-gdrive\-access\fR] [\fB\-\-force\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-launch\-browser\fR] [\fIGLOBAL\-FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Obtains access credentials for your user account via a web\-based authorization
flow. When this command completes successfully, it sets the active account in
the current configuration to the account specified. If no configuration exists,
it creates a configuration named default.

If valid credentials for an account are already available from a prior
authorization, the account is set to active without rerunning the flow.

Use \f5gcloud auth list\fR to view credentialed accounts.

Deprecated behavior: This command also saves the credentials for Application
Default Credentials. This behavior has been taken over by \f5gcloud auth
application\-default login\fR, so prefer to use that command instead for that
purpose.
