.SH "FLAGS"

\fB\-\-delete\-disks\fR {\fIboot\fR,\fIdata\fR,\fIall\fR}
.RS 2m
The types of disks to delete with instance deletion regardless of the disks'
auto\-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the auto\-delete bits on
the attached disks are modified accordingly before the instance deletion
requests are issued. For more information on disk auto\-deletion, see
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/persistent\-disks#updateautodelete

.RE
\fB\-\-keep\-disks\fR {\fIboot\fR,\fIdata\fR,\fIall\fR}
.RS 2m
The types of disks to not delete with instance deletion regardless of the disks'
auto\-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the auto\-delete bits on
the attached disks are modified accordingly before the instance deletion
requests are issued. For more information on disk auto\-deletion, see
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/persistent\-disks#updateautodelete

.RE
\fB\-\-zone\fR \fIZONE\fR
.RS 2m
The zone of the instances to delete. If not specified, you will be prompted to
select a zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.
