.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute instances move\fR facilitates moving a Google Compute Engine
virtual machine from one zone to another. Moving a virtual machine may incur
downtime if the guest OS must be shutdown in order to quiesce disk volumes prior
to snapshotting.

For example, running:.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute instances move example\-instance\-1 \e
   \-\-zone us\-central1\-b \-\-destination\-zone us\-central1\-f

.RE

will move the instance called example\-instance\-1, currently running in
us\-central1\-b, to us\-central1\-f.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fIINSTANCE\fR
.RS 2m
The name of the instance to move.


.RE

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

\fB\-\-destination\-zone\fR \fIDESTINATION_ZONE\fR
.RS 2m
The zone to move the instance to.


.RE

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

\fB\-\-zone\fR \fIZONE\fR
.RS 2m
The zone of the instance to move. If not specified, you will be prompted to
select a zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.


.RE

.SH "GLOBAL FLAGS"

Run \fB$ gcloud help\fR for a description of flags available to all commands.
