.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute backend\-services update\fR is used to update backend
services.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fINAME\fR
.RS 2m
The name of the backend service.


.RE

.SH "FLAGS"

\fB\-\-affinity\-cookie\-ttl\fR \fIAFFINITY_COOKIE_TTL\fR
.RS 2m
If session\-affinity is set to "generated_cookie", this flag sets the TTL, in
seconds, of the resulting cookie. A setting of 0 indicates that the cookie
should be transient.

.RE
\fB\-\-description\fR \fIDESCRIPTION\fR
.RS 2m
An optional, textual description for the backend service.

.RE
\fB\-\-enable\-cdn\fR
.RS 2m
Enable Cloud CDN for the backend service. Cloud CDN can cache HTTP responses
from a backend service at the edge of the network, close to users. Cloud CDN is
disabled by default. Use \fB\-\-no\-enable\-cdn\fR to disable.

.RE
\fB\-\-http\-health\-checks\fR \fIHTTP_HEALTH_CHECK\fR,[\fIHTTP_HEALTH_CHECK\fR,...]
.RS 2m
Specifies a list of HTTP health check objects for checking the health of the
backend service.

.RE
\fB\-\-https\-health\-checks\fR \fIHTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK\fR,[\fIHTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK\fR,...]
.RS 2m
Specifies a list of HTTPS health check objects for checking the health of the
backend service.

.RE
\fB\-\-port\fR \fIPORT\fR
.RS 2m
The TCP port to use when connecting to the backend. \-\-port is being deprecated
in favor of \-\-port\-name.

.RE
\fB\-\-port\-name\fR \fIPORT_NAME\fR
.RS 2m
The name of a service that has been added to an instance group in this backend.
Instance group services map a name to a port number which is used by the load
balancing service. Only one \f5\fIport\-name\fR\fR may be added to a backend
service, and that name must exist as a service on all instance groups that are a
part of this backend service. The port number associated with the name may
differ between instances. If you do not specify this flag, your instance groups
must have a service named \f5\fIhttp\fR\fR configured. See also \f5gcloud
compute instance\-groups set\-named\-ports \-\-help\fR.

.RE
\fB\-\-protocol\fR \fIPROTOCOL\fR
.RS 2m
The protocol for incoming requests.

.RE
\fB\-\-session\-affinity\fR \fISESSION_AFFINITY\fR
.RS 2m
The type of session affinity to use for this backend service. Possible values
are:

.RS 2m
.IP "\(em" 2m
none: Session affinity is disabled.
.RE
.RS 2m
.IP "\(em" 2m
client_ip: Route requests to instances based on the hash of the client's IP
address.
.RE
.RS 2m
.IP "\(em" 2m
generated_cookie: Route requests to instances based on the contents of the
"GCLB" cookie set by the load balancer.
.RE
.RE

\fB\-\-timeout\fR \fITIMEOUT\fR
.RS 2m
The amount of time to wait for a backend to respond to a request before
considering the request failed. For example, specifying \f5\fI10s\fR\fR will
give backends 10 seconds to respond to requests. Valid units for this flag are
``s'' for seconds, ``m'' for minutes, and ``h'' for hours.


.RE

.SH "GLOBAL FLAGS"

Run \fB$ gcloud help\fR for a description of flags available to all commands.
