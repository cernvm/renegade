.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This command imports record\-sets contained within the specified record\-sets
file into your managed\-zone. Note that NS records for the origin of the zone,
and the SOA NS field, are not imported since name\-servers are managed by Cloud
DNS. By default, record\-sets cannot be imported if there are any conflicts. A
conflict exists if an existing record\-set has the same name and type as a
record\-set that is being imported. In contrast, if the
\-\-delete\-all\-existing flag is used, the imported record\-sets will replace
all the records\-sets currently in the managed\-zone.
