Certain tarfiles, like that for Expect, will not build properly: -- module: ../modules/Expect-1.21.tar.gz -- Metadata retrieval Tarball extraction: [/home/dogcow/rpmbuild/SOURCES/Expect-1.21.tar.gz] Can't stat /tmp/uT6ppdd5yr/12:41:12: No such file or directory at ./cpan2rpm line 386 This is because the tarfile has an embedded space in the group name ("Domain Users"), and the offending line of code (1262) is $_ = (split)[5] unless $zip; and will thus fail unless your version of tar happens to rewrite embedded spaces as something else. I'd suggest changing the code to something like ($_) = (m/(\S+)$/) unless $zip; which will always match the last field - unless, of course, someone inexplicably embedded spaces there as well.
