    - XML::SAX::Expat went through a thorough round of testing. A number of
      bugs were found and addressed
    - start_document and end_document used to get the same hash, which is
      wrong
    - same for start_prefix_mapping and end_prefix_mapping
    - deprecated xml_decl() in favour of adding fields to start_document()
    - removed some useless manipulations of the element stack
    - end_dtd() now correctly passes an empty hash instead of nothing, as
      wouldn't start_cdata and end_cdata
    - element_decl would return XML::Parser::ContentModel objects instead of
      a content model string.
    - PublicId would sometimes be undef on external_entity_decl()

    - added supported_features(), as well as support for
      http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities and
      http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities. XML::SAX::Base
      or XML::SAX::ParserFactory seem to have a bug in that they don't blow
      up on unsupported features. Thanks to the numerous people on the perl-xml
      list that supplied patches for this.
